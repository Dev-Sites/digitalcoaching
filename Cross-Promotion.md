Cross promotion is the act of helping other coaches promote their posts, and in turn having them help promote yours. 

Cross promotion works through reciprocation. People are going to help promote your work on the idea that you'll help promote theirs. Here are some things to know about reciprocation. 

* An upvote on Quora or Medium matters, even if you don't have a lot of followers there. On Medium, 40 upvotes in an hour can send an article into the top stories list.

* If you're promoting a paid plan, you're expected to put your own referral code on it. Go into your dashboard and find the ?ref=XYZ part of your referral link. You can slap that onto any coach or any coach's plan and get paid for people who sign up.

* Feel free to be choosey about what you share on Twitter & Facebook. That's your audience. But when it comes to voting, you should be very liberal. To put it this way, I can't flood by Twitter feed with 50 tweets, but I can vote for hundreds of articles on Medium.
