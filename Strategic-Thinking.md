A top employee has responsibility for both the craft of their work and the results of their work. People who want responsibility for the results are special and invaluable.

### Habits
* Set priorities. This is a duplicate habit from an earlier goal, but it’s the right hook to ask for and prepare for conversations.

### Common Questions and Prompts

* What’s the most important thing you’re working on today? Why?
* How can you measure the impact of that?
* Is that enough impact? Does it need to be revised?
* Is there any work on your plate that shouldn’t be done at all?

### Mastery Characteristics

* Knows what moves the company forward. Can trace every work task back to the bottom line success of the company.
* Prioritizes time toward work that produces the biggest impact on the company.
* Scopes priorities into concrete chunks. Concrete means: usable. Chunk means: within a day.

### Completes work that has been prioritized.

* Measures the impact of their work.
* Retries or cancels things that don’t work (most things).
* Learns and avoids work tasks that have no impact.
* Knows that scope and impact are not tightly correlated.
* Proves impact of large projects early. Is capable of dropping a large project if it’s not going to succeed.
