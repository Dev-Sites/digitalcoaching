**Coach.me's default philosophy on coaching is to focus on building momentum with daily consistency.**

Practically everything we've ever encountered in behavior design relies on or is aided by focusing on consistency first. This is the unique value proposition of online coaching--coaches can now make daily contact which means they can focus their coaching on immediate and repeatable actions. It's like the difference between sitting in an office once per week to talk about your golf swing versus being on the driving range every day with a swing instructor.

Focusing on consistency has the following benefits:

1. All coaching advice and optimizations are triggered by reality-based observations.
2. Your client sees immediate results and doesn't have to worry about the investment they're making in your coaching.
3. You open up opportunities for positive reinforcement and shaping (a la Karen Pryor).
4. You change mindsets (a la Carol Dweck). Proof of progress creates confidence that a client is capable of growth.
5. Works with online coaching when you have to rely on text and asynchronous communication. Other methods flat out don't work.

After you've built consistency, you'll have plenty of opportunity to build skill. Just remember: consistency first, skills second.

We follow a coaching methodology based on momentum.

## The Four Phases of Momentum

### Phase 1: Assessment
Start with Assessment. What is the person's larger goal and why? What do they expect from their coach? You need this assessment in order to identify and initial practice and to be able to personalize your coaching. 

### Phase 2: Habituation
Use the assessment to move on to Habituation. Find a regular practice that will support your client's larger goal. Then focus on building consistency. 

### Phase 3: Growth
Once there is consistency, you can work on Growth. This where you can expand the difficulty of the practice, build skills, identify and solve challenges, and introduce optimizations.

### Phase 4: Graduation
4. You and your client should look for Graduation milestones where you can re-assess and either end the coaching relationship or restart the momentum cycle based on what you and your client learned the first time through. It's much better to do multiple trips through the Momentum Cycle than it is to be bogged down in one phase.
