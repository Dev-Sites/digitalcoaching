Everyone Coach.me coach has the opportunity to make money by referring clients into Coach.me. All you need to understand is referral tracking.

There are two ways we track referrals.

#1. If a client follows a link to coach.me that includes your referral code, then we'll give you credit for anything that they buy. Your referral code can be found in the Referral & Promo Codes section of your coaching dashboard. I'll explain more below, but for now, just know that they look something like this: [https://www.coach.me/tony?ref=DbvXq](https://www.coach.me/tony?ref=DbvXq)

#2. If a client uses your promo code they'll get a week of chat coaching for free and also you'll get credit as the referrer. The promo code is also available in the Referral & Promo Codes section of your coaching dashboard. Mine looks like TONYWEEK.

Now, why does this matter? 

We give very generous referral bonuses starting at 20% and working up to 40%. [The full details are on our payment page.](http://training.coach.me/article/123-how-does-payment-work).

Now here are some specific tips.

#1. You get referral bonuses for referring people to yourself. Win-win. 

#2. A lot of coaches refer their existing clients to other coaches. Usually this happens when the coach feels that someone else would be a better fit. 

#3. People don't treat coaches as commodities (thankfully!), but that also means you can't just say, "Great deal on coaches!". You need to tell a story. What goes into the story? We give a simple framework which we call WiSH. There are three parts. You need to talk about Who the client wishes they could be. That's the inspiration. You need to give Social proof, as in testimonials. Then you need to explain How. That answers objections from their rational brain. It helps if you're actually a great coach and know what you're talking about.

#4. You can even get referral bonuses for helping us sell Enterprise coaching. These are deals that give individual referral bonuses of more than $1,000. 

#5. It's easy to understand your referral link if you understand URLs. You have a code that you append to any URL. 

I'm going to give you a layman's take on URLs. 

This is a URL: http://coach.me

So is this: https://www.coach.me/tony/455732#goal

So is this (and it's got my referral code in it): https://www.coach.me/tony/455732?ref=DbvXq#goal

That last URL has four parts parts, the domain (www.coach.me), the path (/tony/455732), the query string (?ref=DbvXq) and an anchor (#goal).

Your referral code goes in the query string, which starts with a ?.

If there isn't a query string already, then you need to add it. For example: http://coach.me?ref=DbvXq

It seems like this always goes on the end. But that's not 100% true. It goes after the path and before any anchor. 

So this is right (after the path, before the anchor): https://www.coach.me/tony/455732?ref=DbvXq#goal

And this is wrong (after the anchor): https://www.coach.me/tony/455732#goal?ref=DbvXq
