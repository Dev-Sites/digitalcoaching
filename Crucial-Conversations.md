People should be able to communicate in a way that doesn’t piss off their coworkers. That’s a bare-minimum. After that, communication problems are often about not understanding each other and not delivering bad news (most often missed deadlines and underperforming launches).

### Habits

* Set priorities. This is a duplicate habit from an earlier goal, but it’s the right hook to ask for and prepare for conversations.

### Common Questions and Prompts

* Are you on any deadlines? Do you have any concerns about meeting them?
* Do you have anything to delegate?
* Are people relying on you for anything this week? Do you need to update them on anything?
* Do you feel any tension with anyone in the org? What’s the content of the disagreement?
* Are people meeting commitments that they’ve made to you? Do you think they understood the commitment in the same way that you did?
* Have you agreed to anything that you now think is a bad idea?

### Mastery Characteristics

* Lead emails with the main point or request.
* Communicate changes to schedules.
* Always delegate with a clear action item. If possible, confirm that this delegation is tracked.
* Converts all disagreements into substantive conversations.
* Listens well and proves it by mirroring back to people.
* Changes opinions based on new information.
* Has difficult conversations in person. Does not delay on these conversations.
