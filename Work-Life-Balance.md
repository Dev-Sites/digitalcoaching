Life should not interrupt work. This is not about hours in the office — it’s about effectiveness of those hours. People should be rested, healthy and free of distractions during their work day.

### Habits

All habits turn out to help. Here are some of the main ones.

* Sleep 8 hours.
* Get to work by 10am (i.e. no dawdling in the morning)
* Set priorities (including home life)
* Meditate (this is the limit to how far we should coach emotional or therapy issues).
* No alcohol (do not address addiction — but do suggest this to people that have a party habit)

### Common Questions and Prompts

* How are your energy levels at the beginning of the day and the middle of the afternoon?
* Did any personal responsibilities come up today?

Mastery Characteristics

* Arrive to work healthy. That means sober, rested and fed.
* Block off times during the week to get personal projects done: groceries, cooking, exercise, chores.
* Get consistent sleep.
* Delegate chores to services.
* Exercise regularly.
