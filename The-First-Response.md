The first time you hear from a client is when they sign up and respond to your welcome message. Your response to that message should include active listening.

1. Use the 4 R's:repeat, restate, reframe, and relate to what the client has said. You need to show them that you heard them. That way they know that all of your future coaching is personal to them and also that it's worth answering your questions. Most commonly, coaches screw this up by responding immediately with more questions or direct advice.

B. Your methodology. Now that you've done an initial assessment, let the client know where the coaching is going to go. This gives context for whatever next step you give in part C. Most commonly, you'll be using our Momentum Method as a guide, so say something like, "I follow the guidelines of Coach.me's Momentum Methodology, which is to focus on consitency first, then grow technique/difficulty, and then find an early milestone where we can celebrate and evaluate your progress."

C. Next step. This could be more questions or a specific exercise that relates to the methodology you describe. In Momentum Method, you'll be turning a goal into a consistent habit.

Here's what this looks like in practice. Imagine a client who has signed up for meditation and who has described a golfing situation where he has felt anxiety. This is a response that uses Active Listening:

>**[Active Listening: Relate to the person and restate their goal]**
>
>"Great to meet you and thanks for giving me a try.
>
>I'm a big believer in meditation for the goals you talk about. It's exactly as you describe, you build an awareness >of the hundreds of strange thoughts that go through your head. And then one day you'll say to yourself, "Oh, I'm >being watched by the fourball and that's making me feel nervous."  

>Then you'll put that thought down and bring your focus back to your breath. And then you'll be calm again.

**[Momentum: explain the basics of methodology so that the client knows what's coming.]**

To set expectations, I follow the guidelines of Coach.me's Momentum Methodology, which is to focus on consistency first, then grow technique/difficulty, and then find an early milestone where we can celebrate and evaluate your progress.

**[Next Action: suggest a potential first exercise, but be open to the client's feedback because you may not have all of the information yet.]**

First, our focus will be to build a regular practice that you can do daily or at least multiple times per week.

What is your experience with meditation? Have you ever meditated before? How did it go? Do you have an idea about when and where you want to meditate? How many times per week do you want to meditate?

Without knowing your experience with meditation, I would suggest something very small and simple. Here's a great minimal practice that you can do no matter experience or time pressure:

Sit down. Close your eyes. Take five deep breaths.

That might sound trivial, but if you can do that multiple times per week, then you're going to be able to expand that into a serious meditation practice.

>If that exercise doesn't feel right, or you have something else in mind, let me know and we can talk though it."
