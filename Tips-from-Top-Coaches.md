Here are the top ten tips featured in the training video:

1. The #1 coach on Coach.me is an amateur; learning how to be a great coach online is a different skill set from being a great in-person coach.

2. 90% of problems stem from not being able to see the client or hear their voice.

3. Questions work better than advice.

4. Mirroring is a technique that great coaches use.

5. Clarity and expectation setting is the key to a client-coach relationship on Coach.me.

6. Know and share your response schedule with clients.

7. Ask deeper questions early in the relationship.

8. Stay positive, even when clients become non-responsive and disappear. It happens.

9. Keep reaching out; many clients eventually return.

10. Practice humility when offering advice and confidence when asking questions.
