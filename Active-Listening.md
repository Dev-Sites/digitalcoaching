This is the most important strategy and habit for digital coaching.

Active listening lets your client know that they're being heard and that they're not just getting boilerplate copy-and-paste from you. This can be especially important to connect the dots between what the client is telling you and what you're advising them to do.

It's also especially important in digital coaching because your clients don't see the physical and verbal active listening cues that you show in an in-person coaching session, such as the tone of your voice, eye contact, or nodding of your head. 

Active listening can be as simple as just repeating back what you’ve heard. In fact, that's really important even if it seems repetitive to do so (since their response is right there above your message!). By repeating what you've said to the client, they feel heard.

You create three problems in your relationship with your client if you don't use active listening strategies. 

1. You will give incorrect advice and not know it. This is either because you literally haven’t heard your client’s problems because you’re not making listening a priority, or because your client doesn’t think you’re listening and so they don’t feel like it’s worth correcting you.

2. Your client will put less effort into their answers to your questions because they don’t feel like that effort will be acknowledged.

3. Your client will lose trust in your advice because they don’t feel that it is personalized.

You probably already think you are a good listener, but do your clients? Many of the patterns include some variation on technique from NLP  (Neuro Linguistic Programming) called keyword backtracking.

That’s a fancy way to say that active listening involved noting important keywords that your client uses and then repeating those keywords back to them.

Next are the most common active listening patterns in digital coaching.
