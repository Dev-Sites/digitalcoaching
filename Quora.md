These are instructions for how Coaches can get page views for themselves on Quora. 

**1) The first step to using Quora is to write.** 

Here's something amazing about Quora: it drives traffic for years after you write. Tony did a lot of writing on Quora in 2014 just for fun. He didn't have any big plans--he just wrote about things that he knew about. Apparently he wrote a lot because they gave him a Top Writer designation. The amazing part is this: despite not having written in more than a year, Tony still gets 9,000 views per month on his answers.  

9,000 page views per month for not doing any work is pretty good. I think we can do better. The first thing to do is to write:

* We've collected a short list of starter questions. See if you can answer a couple of these before searching for more questions: http://bit.ly/coachquoraquestions

* Mention Coach.me. This is required for steps 2 & 3. If you can work a link to Coach.me into your answer, that's ideal. If you can't, Quora lets you set question specific bios. So if you're a Meditation coach, write that in your bio: Meditation Coach on Coach.me.

**2) Add your Quora answers to this form:**

Your answers will be shared with all of the other coaches, even ones who haven't joined yet. 

**3) Give some love to the other coaches**

Here are the answers that other coaches have submitted. As I write this, there are just two links from me, but there will be more shortly:

Go through and upvote the answers that your coaches have written on Quora. You might learn something and, more importantly, you'll be helping your fellow coaches build their businesses. The coaching community we are building is like a cooperative, where we're all working together to build the business of online coaching.
