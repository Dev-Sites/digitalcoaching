We've noticed an anti-pattern where many coaches (more than half) struggled to communicate clearly when they had to share something that didn't seem like good news for the client.

In most cases of this anti-pattern, the coach was avoiding a topic or was refusing to give a clear answer. For example, coaches have to sleep sometime. So if I client asks you to check in with them at 3am your time, your answer should come easily and clearly:

>“I can’t check in with you at that time because that is outside of my work hours."

But we saw many coaches give the wrong answer:
>“I’ll try.”

You lose the faith and trust of your client as soon as your behavior deviates from the expectations you have set. Say what you’ll do, and do what you’ll say.

This probably seems really obvious to people—but it’s a problem endemic to coaches. Coaches join this business to help people. That makes saying that you can’t help (in this specific way) difficult. 

Below we’ve broken out the most common situations that call for clear communication. Many of these involve setting expectations and boundaries. It’s your right to set your own work hours and services. It’s your client’s responsibility to exercise “The Law of Two Feet,” meaning that it's their responsibility to leave if a coach isn’t right for them.

1. Set the communication process right away

Initial conversations are where you can establish the answers to the questions that all your clients have:

* What time and what days will they hear from you?
* What is your process?

Here’s an example of what that might look like; this could be part of your automated welcome message in Coach.me. If not, it should definitely be in your first conversations:

>I am excited to work with you! First, I'd like to discuss what being a coach on Coach.me means. I'm strictly an accountability coach. This means I will help you to:
* Set realistic goals. 
* Develop an action plan. 
* Determine how to measure success. 
* Focus and stay on track. 
* Track progress and set deadlines.  

>I'll offer you encouragement and support and work to keep you motivated and on track, but ultimately you are responsible for your success. I'm in touch every day and will be in the chat area at 11am EST Monday through Saturday. Sundays I'll answer questions only. Ready to start?
