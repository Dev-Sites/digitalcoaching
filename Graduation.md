When your client has achieved their goal or an important milestone, you should work them through this graduation step with the goal of revising, reevaluating or truly graduating. 

These are the main potential outcomes:

1. Go through the Momentum Cycle again, starting with a re-assessment to see how to be even better. For example, you could train for one marathon, consider that a graduation moment, and then reassess in order to run faster at a second marathon.

2. Move to an adjacent goal and start the Momentum Cycle for that goal. For example, a productivity coach working on prioritization might follow up with Inbox Zero.

3. Allow for a true goodbye: you've done your work and your client has truly graduated. 

5. Go into maintenance mode. In this period, 90% of your value will be in holding the client accountable. Occasionally you may spot room for improvements, but mostly you'll just be an external source of  motivation.
