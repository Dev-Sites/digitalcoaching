Once you have consistency, you can work on helping the client increase the difficulty. If they're just working on a habit, then you'll work on making the habit permanent. But usually the goal also has a skill or volume component.

There are a million things to do here and a lot of them are specific to the goal that you're coaching. A running coach might work the client through a progressively harder training load. A productivity coach might help their client identify patterns and design processes for handling them, for example, how to quickly process expense reports.

Here are the main tactics:

**1. Spotlighting questions:** You can help the client plan, examine and optimize their own goal. In this mode, you use questions to spotlight area for improvement and the client provides the answers. Go to [Spotlighting Questions](https://github.com/coachdotme/digitalcoaching/wiki/Spotlighting).

**2. Skill progression:** This is where you can use your expertise to improve the client's performance one element at a time. Go to [Deliberate Practice](https://github.com/coachdotme/digitalcoaching/wiki/Deliberate-Practice).

This phase can go on indefinitely, especially if your client is looking to you for accountability. However, it's always better to be on the lookout for a milestone where you can claim success and then start a new trip through the Momentum Cycle.
