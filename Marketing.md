There are many different platforms you can use to market your coaching. Here, we're going to discuss writing for Better Humans and writing on Quora. 


**Better Humans**: Better Humans is a Coach.me run Medium page, which aims to provide intelligent ideas for upgrading yourself.
Here's why you should write for Better Humans:
It has a built in, growing audience of 26k people, all interested in every aspect of human performance.
It's ok to cross post something that you've written somewhere else.
You can generate leads for your coaching business (we ask that you link to your Coach.me profile).

**Quora**: Quora is an online information sharing platform. 
#1. The first step to using Quora is to write 

Here's something amazing about Quora: it drives traffic for years after you write. I did a lot of writing on Quora in 2014 just for fun. I didn't have any big plans--I just wrote about things that I knew about. Apparently I wrote a lot because they gave me a Top Writer designation and sent me a Quora fleece. I think that I totaled 40 or 50 answers that year. But that's not the amazing part, this is: despite not having written in almost a year, I still get 9,000 views per month on my answers.  

9,000 page views per month for not doing any work is pretty good. I think we can do better. The first thing to do is to write:

* We've collected a short list of starter questions. See if you can answer a couple of these before searching for more questions: http://bit.ly/coachquoraquestions

* Mention Coach.me. This is required for steps 2 & 3. If you can work a link to Coach.me into your answer, that's ideal. If you can't, Quora lets you set question specific bios. So if you're a Meditation coach, write that in your bio: Meditation Coach on Coach.me.

#2. Add your Quora answers to this form:

Your answers will be shared with all of the other coaches, even ones who haven't joined yet. 

#3. Give some love to the other coaches.

Here are the answers that other coaches have submitted. As I write this, there are just two links from me, but there will be more shortly:

Go through and upvote the answers that your coaches have written on Quora. You might learn something and, more importantly, you'll be helping your fellow coaches build their businesses. The coaching community we are building is like a cooperative, where we're all working together to build the business of online coaching.
