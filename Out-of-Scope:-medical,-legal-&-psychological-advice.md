Some clients are looking for medical or psychological help. Issues like depression and suicide are scary and need to be treated seriously. Your responsibility is to recognize that you and the Coach.me format are not an appropriate solution (it says this explicitly in our Terms of Service). 

Here’s a general template for your response:

> Client_name—my heart really goes out to you. You're dealing with some heavy issues. What you're asking for here is something different than coaching. I'm going to have to turn down the chance to continue working with you. I recommend that you look for the services of a medical or therapeutic professional instead. Here's how you can cancel coaching: http://support.coach.me/article/25-cancel  

>If you don't cancel in a day or so, I'll go ahead and ask our support staff to cancel for you. If you need any help with your cancelation, you can contact them directly at billing@coach.me.

Here are templates for specific situations:

### Suicide or Depression

>Coach.me requires that I give a very specific answer to certain topics of suicide or depression. These are topics that need to be addressed by an experienced professional and for that reason are off limits as topics of conversation between clients and coaches.

>If you are feeling suicidal, I urge you to call the National Suicide Prevention Hotline right now. The number is 800-273-8255.

>If you are feeling depressed, Coach.me recommends an equivalent therapy-focused service called Talkspace.com. It works a lot like Coach.me, except with therapists.

>I can continue to coach you on other goals, I’m just not allowed to discuss suicide or depression beyond the above."

>As the text says, this is not a suggestion but a requirement that we have for all coaches when serious issues like suicide come up. More info is here under section 4.
