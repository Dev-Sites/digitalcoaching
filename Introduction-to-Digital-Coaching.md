Hello current and future digital coaches. Here is a free-to-use guide, training materials and scripts for digital coaching. 

We define digital coaching as coaching that takes place in a native digital format, mainly email, text messaging, or in-app chat. Contrast this with face-to-face coaching which can be imitated over Skype or phone. 

Digital coaching is a different format of coaching with different strengths, rhythms, and challenges. 

Below you'll find a guide that was drawn from the coaching community at Coach.me. This guide is also part of the training materials and digital coaching certification that all Coach.me coaches go through. 

But it's not a Coach.me guide per se. Any coach who coaches any client digitally, should feel free to use, adopt, adapt, and even contribute to this guide. We've licensed the materials as Creative Commons which means that you are legally free to use anything here as long as you give attribution.

Enough of that, let's start talking about how to be a great coach.
