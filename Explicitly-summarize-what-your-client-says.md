Sometimes it’s good to just pause and summarize what you’ve heard back to your client. 

Do this when your client has told you important information that you’re going to base future coaching decisions on. Finish your summary by asking your client to confirm your understanding. This is an invitation to your client that you are open to their feedback now and in the future. 

Here's an example:

>I want to be sure I understand your plan for this week: you're going to unplug the internet connection before going to bed and you're going to get up when the alarm goes off. Is that right?
