Generally, most clients are relying on their own motivation. Your job is then to make them smarter and more efficient so that their own motivation is sufficient. However, there are two motivational strategies that play a big role.

### Accountability

By default, coaches also play an accountability role. Accountability is a powerful form of motivation, and is why you should continue to follow up with a client even if they don’t seem to be responding. If that happens, try some of our [scripts for handling AWOL clients](https://github.com/coachdotme/digitalcoaching/wiki/Coaching-Disengaged-Clients).

You shouldn’t ever be mean or negative. Just keep checking in with your client every day. That will keep the goal top of mind for them and produce a sense of accountability in many clients.

### Positive Reinforcement

Your second role is as a form of positive reinforcement. Help your client identify and name good decisions. For example, in a diet coaching relationship, it’s very helpful for a client to be aware of previous good decisions so that they don’t have to think very hard in order to remember them.

As a coach, you can even keep a list.

- Salad from Buckhorn 
- Japanese service from Samovar 
- Vegetarian burrito at La Taqueria
